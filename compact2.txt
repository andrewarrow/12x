This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The 
  conversation is summarized below:
  <analysis>
  Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to ensure a thorough summary:

  1. Initial Request:
     - User requested a change from chat feature to a calendar feature in an iOS app
     - The calendar should show 12 months and allow editing 1 day per month with title and location
     - Data should be saved locally and transmitted over Bluetooth

  2. Understanding the Codebase:
     - I examined BluetoothManager.swift, BluetoothDevice.swift, and DeviceDetailView.swift
     - Current implementation was a chat feature using Bluetooth
     - Chat messages were stored and transmitted between devices

  3. Implementation Approach:
     - Created CalendarEntry and CalendarData models replacing ChatMessage
     - Updated BluetoothManager to handle calendar data instead of chat
     - Implemented local storage for calendar entries using UserDefaults
     - Created a new UI for the calendar in DeviceDetailView
     - Adjusted Bluetooth code to transmit calendar data

  4. Technical Issues and Solutions:
     - Issue 1: "prepare queue is full" error during Bluetooth transmission
     - Solution 1: Added chunking to send data in smaller pieces
     - Issue 2: Receiver not getting complete data
     - Solution 2: Implemented data reassembly on receiver side
     - Issue 3: "Extensions must not contain stored properties" error
     - Solution 3: Moved properties to the main class
     - Issue 4: Connection being closed too early
     - Solution 4: Added delays to keep connection open longer

  5. Current Work:
     - Most recently working on fixing premature disconnection issues
     - Implemented sequential chunk sending with delays
     - Added a delay before disconnection
     - Working to ensure receiver gets and processes all chunks before connection is closed

  6. Technical Details:
     - Files modified: BluetoothManager.swift, BluetoothDevice.swift, DeviceDetailView.swift
     - APIs used: CoreBluetooth, UserDefaults, Swift concurrency with DispatchQueue
     - Data models: CalendarEntry, CalendarData replacing ChatMessage
     - Bluetooth communication: Using chunked data transmission with reassembly
  </analysis>

  <summary>
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user requested to change the app's chat feature to a calendar feature where:
     - When selecting a Bluetooth device (IsSameApp), the detail page shows a calendar with 12 
  months
     - Users can edit 1 day on each month with a title and location
     - This calendar data is saved locally and transmitted over Bluetooth to other devices
     - When a receiving phone gets the calendar data, it replaces its own calendar data with the 
  received data

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - CoreBluetooth communication (CBCentralManager, CBPeripheralManager)
     - JSON data serialization and deserialization for Bluetooth transmission
     - Data chunking for handling Bluetooth transmission limitations
     - Swift property wrappers (@Published) for state management
     - UserDefaults for persistent local storage
     - Asynchronous operations with DispatchQueue
     - SwiftUI for calendar interface
     - Delegates and callbacks for Bluetooth events

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/Users/aa/os/12x/ConnectWith/Models/BluetoothDevice.swift`
       - Created new model classes `CalendarEntry` and `CalendarData` replacing `ChatMessage`
       - Added Codable conformance for JSON serialization
       - Important for defining the data structure for calendar entries
       ```swift
       struct CalendarEntry: Identifiable, Codable {
           let id: UUID
           var title: String
           var location: String
           var month: Int // 1-12 for the months of the year
           
           init(title: String = "", location: String = "", month: Int) {
               self.id = UUID()
               self.title = title
               self.location = location
               self.month = month
           }
       }
       ```

     - `/Users/aa/os/12x/ConnectWith/Models/BluetoothManager.swift`
       - Modified to handle calendar data instead of chat messages
       - Added methods for saving/loading calendar entries using UserDefaults
       - Implemented data chunking for reliable Bluetooth transmission
       - Added buffer for reassembling received chunks
       - Most critical file containing the Bluetooth logic
       ```swift
       // Sequential chunk sending implementation
       for chunkIndex in 0..<totalChunks {
           let delay = 2.0 + (Double(chunkIndex) * 0.5) // 2 seconds initial delay, 0.5 second 
  between chunks
           
           DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + delay) { [weak self] in
               guard let self = self, self.sendingCalendarData else { return }
               
               // Calculate the current chunk's data
               let startIndex = chunkIndex * chunkSize
               let endIndex = min(startIndex + chunkSize, data.count)
               let chunkData = data.subdata(in: startIndex..<endIndex)
               
               self.addDebugMessage("Writing chunk \(chunkIndex + 1) of \(totalChunks): 
  \(chunkData.count) bytes")
               peripheral.writeValue(chunkData, for: characteristic, type: .withResponse)
               
               // If this is the last chunk, schedule success after a delay
               if chunkIndex == totalChunks - 1 {
                   DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 3.0) { [weak self] in
                       guard let self = self, self.sendingCalendarData else { return }
                       self.addDebugMessage("All chunks sent, completing operation")
                       self.finishCalendarDataSending(success: true)
                   }
               }
           }
       }
       ```

     - `/Users/aa/os/12x/ConnectWith/Views/DeviceDetailView.swift`
       - Completely replaced chat UI with calendar UI
       - Implemented month selection, entry editing, and data sending
       - Core of the user interface for the calendar feature
       ```swift
       struct DeviceDetailView: View {
           @EnvironmentObject var bluetoothManager: BluetoothManager
           let device: BluetoothDevice
           
           // State variables for the currently selected month and entry
           @State private var selectedMonth: Int = Calendar.current.component(.month, from: Date())
           @State private var entryTitle: String = ""
           @State private var entryLocation: String = ""
           
           // Month names
           let monthNames = [
               "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",
               "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"
           ]
           
           var body: some View {
               // Calendar UI implementation
           }
       }
       ```

     - `/Users/aa/os/12x/ConnectWith/Views/BluetoothDeviceListView.swift`
       - Updated alert system to handle calendar data instead of chat messages
       - Modified to show alerts for received calendar data

     - `/Users/aa/os/12x/ConnectWith/Views/SplashScreen.swift`
       - Minor update to add calendar icon to reflect the app's new functionality

  4. Problem Solving:
     - Bluetooth Transmission Issues:
       - Solved "prepare queue is full" error by implementing data chunking
       - Improved chunking with sequential sending and appropriate delays
       - Added buffer for reassembling chunks on the receiver side
       - Implemented delayed disconnection to ensure data transfer completes

     - Code Structure Issues:
       - Fixed "Extensions must not contain stored properties" error by moving properties to the 
  main class
       - Created proper separation of concerns between data models and Bluetooth functionality

     - Data Transfer Reliability:
       - Implemented retry mechanism for failed writes
       - Added JSON validation and logging for debugging
       - Created timeout handling to prevent stuck operations

  5. Pending Tasks:
     - None explicitly stated by the user

  6. Current Work:
     The most recent work focused on fixing issues with the Bluetooth data transmission process:
     - Implementing sequential chunk sending with appropriate delays between chunks
     - Adding a delay before disconnection to ensure the receiver has time to process all chunks
     - Fixing the issue where the connection was being closed prematurely after the first chunk
     - Adding protection against race conditions and multiple completion calls
     - Implementing better debug logging for transmitted and received JSON data

  7. Optional Next Step:
     Based on the most recent work, a logical next step would be to:
     - Test the complete calendar data transfer flow and validate that chunked data is properly 
  reassembled
     - Consider implementing a progress indicator in the UI to show the status of data transfers
     - Add a mechanism to verify data integrity after transmission
