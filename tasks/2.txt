now lets implement Wi-Fi (Multipeer Connectivity framework)
Using Apple's Multipeer Connectivity framework for same-network communication.
Change the instructions after a few second to say:

"make sure your family member's phone is on your same wifi."

define a service called "12x" and do

Create a session with your service type identifier
Configure the session with a display name and optional security settings
Start advertising your service OR start browsing for advertisers
Handle invitation events (sending/receiving)
Exchange data once connected

Both founds should advertise and both should browse. The goal is to display
the name of the phone on each other's screen when found.
Once found stop the process bar and show success emoji.
