Implement basic Bluetooth data transfer mechanism:

1. Create a BluetoothTransferManager class to handle data exchange
2. Add a new characteristic for sync data to the existing Bluetooth service
3. Implement methods to send chunks of JSON data via Bluetooth
4. Create receiver code to handle and reassemble incoming data chunks
5. Add progress tracking for both sending and receiving operations
6. Implement proper error handling for transfer failures
7. Add detailed logging with "[BTTransfer]" prefix for all Bluetooth transfer operations

Debug Logging Requirements:
- Log transfer initialization: "[BTTransfer] Starting transfer to device {name}, data size: {bytes}"
- Log chunk transmission: "[BTTransfer] Sending chunk {current}/{total}, size: {bytes}"
- Log chunk reception: "[BTTransfer] Received chunk {current}/{total}, size: {bytes}"
- Log progress updates: "[BTTransfer] Transfer progress: {percent}%"
- Log any transfer errors with full error details: "[BTTransfer] Error during transfer: {error}"
- Log transfer completion: "[BTTransfer] Transfer completed, total bytes: {bytes}, time: {seconds}s"
- Log all characteristic discoveries and subscriptions: "[BTTransfer] Found sync characteristic: {uuid}"

Testing Instructions (Two Phones):
1. Build and run the app on both phones
2. Connect both phones through the Family tab (ensure status shows "connected")
3. Add a temporary debug UI with two buttons:
   - "Send Test Data": Sends a small predefined JSON string
   - "Transfer Status": Shows current transfer stats
4. On Phone A, tap "Send Test Data" to initiate a test transfer to Phone B
5. Check Phone A's console logs for:
   - Initialization of transfer
   - Chunk transmission logs
   - Progress updates
   - Completion log
6. Check Phone B's console logs for:
   - Reception of data chunks
   - Reassembly of complete data
   - Validation of received data
7. Repeat the test sending data from Phone B to Phone A
8. Test error handling by:
   - Starting a transfer and turning off Bluetooth on the receiver
   - Putting one device in airplane mode during transfer
   - Moving devices far apart during transfer

For each test, capture detailed logs from both sending and receiving devices and save them for debugging if any issues occur.
