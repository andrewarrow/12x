replace the main menu screen in this app and turn it into an onboarding new user page.
when the app is first launched it should say "Welcome to 12x" scanning for devices.
Show a progress bar. Print the instructions:

"Now have your family member also install this app and launch it on their phone."

Make the progress bar fun to look at, making some emoji's appear and "dance" while we
are waiting.

In the next step we will actually start on the networking code but for now just have this never
ending progress bar.
