Right now the app start in onboarding mode correctly for how a brand new user
should enter. But once a user reaches the MAIN section of the app with
the three tabs, record something to disk so that next time the app starts,
the user skips onboarding and goes directly to the main section.

In the upper right corner of the main screen is a refresh button that 
currently doesn't do anything. Make it scan for new devices and
add them to the list with status "new" if new but remember to de-dup.
