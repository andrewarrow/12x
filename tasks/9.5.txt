Connect sync UI to Bluetooth transfer mechanism:

1. Integrate BluetoothTransferManager with the sync modal UI
2. Update the progress indicator based on transfer progress
3. Display real-time statistics (bytes sent/received) during sync
4. Implement cancel functionality to abort transfers
5. Add proper error handling and user feedback for sync issues
6. Create a completion handler for successful transfers
7. Add detailed logging with "[SyncProcess]" prefix for all UI/transfer integration points

Debug Logging Requirements:
- Log UI-Transfer connection: "[SyncProcess] Sync modal connected to transfer manager for device: {name}"
- Log UI updates: "[SyncProcess] Updating UI with progress: {percent}%, bytes: {sent}/{total}"
- Log user actions: "[SyncProcess] User pressed cancel button, aborting transfer"
- Log transfer state transitions: "[SyncProcess] Transfer state changed: {oldState} -> {newState}"
- Log error display: "[SyncProcess] Showing error to user: {errorMessage}"
- Log completion handling: "[SyncProcess] Transfer completed, showing success state"
- Log transfer statistics: "[SyncProcess] Final transfer stats - Total bytes: {bytes}, time: {seconds}s, speed: {kbps}kB/s"

Testing Instructions (Two Phones):
1. Build and run the app on both phones
2. Create multiple calendar events on Phone A (at least 5 events)
3. Connect both phones and navigate to the Family tab
4. On Phone A, tap the "Sync" button for Phone B
5. Observe the sync modal with real-time progress updates:
   - Progress bar should advance smoothly
   - Bytes transferred should update in real-time
   - Transfer speed should be displayed
6. Verify completion:
   - Progress should reach 100%
   - Success message should appear
   - Detailed transfer stats should be shown
7. Check Phone A's console logs for all progress updates
8. Check Phone B's console logs for all received chunk logs
9. Test cancellation:
   - Start another sync
   - Press cancel button mid-transfer
   - Verify transfer stops immediately
   - Check logs for cancellation messages
10. Test error handling:
    - Start sync, then put one phone in airplane mode
    - Verify error message appears on UI
    - Check logs for detailed error information

If any part of the process fails, capture screenshots of the UI state and save complete console logs from both devices.
