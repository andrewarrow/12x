After the user presses next from the end of task 5 they should have 1 or more devices checked.
We need to store those device names and ids in a local database.

Also time for another dramatic change with colors and font. They are entering 
the MAIN AREA of the app.

There are should 3 tabs: Family, Calendar, Settings

Start on the Family tab and list all the devices from the local database.
For each device in the list there should be a status of either "new",
"connected", or "error". All devices start as "new" and there should be an
option to try and connect to each. When that option is selected attempt
to make a bluetooth connection and handshake a simple "HELLO", "HI" back
and forth message to prove its working. If it works change status to "connected" and
if not "error".
