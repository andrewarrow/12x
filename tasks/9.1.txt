Implement local storage for calendar events:

1. Create a CalendarStore class to manage persistent storage of calendar events
2. Implement functions to save and load calendar events using UserDefaults
3. Add model classes for CalendarEvent with properties for title, location, and day
4. Modify existing calendar view to load data from storage on app launch
5. Update the calendar edit functionality to save changes to persistent storage
6. Add detailed debug logging with "[CalendarStore]" prefix for all storage operations

Debug Logging Requirements:
- Log when CalendarStore initializes and loads saved events
- Log each save operation with event details: "[CalendarStore] Saving event: {title} for {month} on day {day}"
- Log when events are retrieved: "[CalendarStore] Loading events from storage, found {count} events"
- Log any errors during save/load operations with clear error messages

Testing Instructions (Single Phone):
1. Build and run the app on your device
2. Go to the Calendar tab
3. Add events for at least 3 different months with unique titles and days
4. Check the Xcode console for save operation logs
5. Force-quit the app completely
6. Relaunch the app and immediately check Xcode console for load operation logs
7. Verify all 3 events appear correctly in the Calendar tab
8. Edit one of the existing events, changing title and day
9. Check console logs show the update operation
10. Force-quit and relaunch again to verify changes persist

If any step fails, copy the complete Xcode console logs from that session and save them for debugging.
