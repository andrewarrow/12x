It's time to store the calendar data to disk. When the user quits the app
and re-enters all their calendar data should still be there.

Also let's start on the feature to sync your calendar data to a family
member over bluetooth. In the Family tab add a new option for "sync"
on each family member only for "connected" ones.

So "new" or "error" status one will not have this option yet.

When you select sync open a modal showing detailed information
about the process. Show stuff like how the bluetooth communication
is going in terms of bytes in or bytes out, and also show
enlgish of stuff like "Andrew has a May event on the 17th for Disneyland
but Bob does not, sending that over."
And also "Bob and Andrew both have an event for June but Bob wants the 7th
and Andrew wants the 17th. Breaking the tie."

Use the date of the change to break the tie. The newest edit wins.
