Now that we are displaying the list of devices with checkboxes it's important
to get the name right. Someone people name their iphone "Bob's Iphone" and we
want to capture that. The GUID id of the device is important, it's keep that
in memory and we'll need it later but for the user just display "Bob" if you can.
If all you have is "iPhone" try and get at least some more information about it.
Use RSSI signal strength or anything else available in Bluetooth to identify
one device from another that will help family members know who's iphone is who's.
There are many ways to get the name of an ios device. Use the same system air
drop does if possible which nicely has the human readable name of ios devices.
