When the first real devices is found make the screen UI change
dramatically so the user really knows something big just happened.

Big color or font changes, they have moved on to STEP 2.

The progress bar and emoji's go away.
The help text about "have your family members also install the app" goes away.
Show a list of the others devices by the name of the phone.
There should be a checkbox UI component next to each device in the false position.
The user can toggle them to true position and the click a button for "next".
They can stay on this page as long as they want. If there is just one device
they might want to wait for 2 or 3 devices to show up.

Some small help text at bottom saying "Select family members..."
