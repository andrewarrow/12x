in the Calendar tab show 12 cards in different colors one for each month stacked
vertically. Look at w.PNG file to see example from the wallet app for how it 
should look. But instead of credit cards, these are cards for each of the 12 months.

The idea of this app called 12x is to schedule 12 events, one per month, with
your family. This is not a normal calendar where you can add an event to any date.
Here you can only pick a month, and then either add the first event for that month
if none exist yet, or edit the event for that month that's already there.

There can only be 1 event per month. Each event should have a title, a location,
and a day within the month.

Just store the data in memory for now. In a future task we'll persist to disk.
Don't worry about syncing the data in the calendar to other family members yet.
